It was the best of times, and the worst of times.  It got real worse when the aliens came down from space and started showing off their glowing green ding dongs.  They would wait in 7-11 parking lots and flashed everyone that walked by with a taquito.  Apparently this is customary in their culture and it means "we are going to skull fuck you if you don't hand over that taquito."
